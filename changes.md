###Conceptual changes:

1. Types are now described in terms of viewing on them as  on sets of restrictions, it creates a stronger basis for describing behaviour of the type system

2. We have a rules for validation of type instances now, type system is strictly defined to be based on open type system.
 
3. Concept of automatic classification is introduced to describe mapping to the nominal type systems. 

4. Algorithm of how types are parsed is decribed as a part of the type system 

5. XML Facet is added to the type system with a set of rules desribing how types should be serialized to XML.
